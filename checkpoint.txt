api setup complete --> all done 
captcha not working  --> captcha working (kept on hold due to development)
file not uploading --> multiple file selection, upload remaining --> upload success, fetch remaining --> fetch success, download error on device --> download success, opening error --> files and folder can be uploaded at once --> can download zip, or individual files but cant open it --> fixed timezone to india in sql && whole zip 200 && partial zip 500  --> fixed timezone for all tables queries && zip download 200 && partial download 200 
chat not chatting

The manage logic would be like I would access the token from the database the zip folder and I will extract it entirely after extracting it on the client side the user will be having the options like whether you want to add something or you want to just like delete something so it will add or delete the files after confirming it it will give news if file and upload it to the same id same token the only thing which will be different would be the zip file and the update timing
